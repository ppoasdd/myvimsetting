To use YouCompleteMe, we should compile install.py 

To do that, follow the guild in 

http://neverapple88.tistory.com/26

sudo apt-get install vim-nox
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
sudo apt-get install python-dev python3-dev
sudo apt-get install clang
sudo apt-get install mono-devel

and move successfully the bundle folder which have the YouCompleteMe folder.






If we meet the following error,

CSC: error CS0518: The predefined type `System.Void' is not defined or importced
CSC: error CS0518: The predefined type `System.Array' is not defined or imported
CSC: error CS0518: The predefined type `System.Type' is not defined or imported
CSC: error CS0518: The predefined type `System.Collections.IEnumerator' is not defined or imported

This is caused by compileing without standard libraries. So we should change default configuration.

To do that,

At first install xbuild.

In terminal, export NoCompilerStandardLib=false  

then complie. (./install.py --all)
